You'll often want to apply the same function to each element of a list or
vector. Extracting each element and applying that function would be tedious, 
create a lot of duplicated code, and be nearly impossible for large lists and 
vectors. Instead, you can use the functions in the purrr package to iterate over
lists and vectors and perform an action at each element. 

In this unit, you'll learn about the most basic purrr functions: the map 
functions. You'll also learn about anonymous functions, which will allow you 
to create custom functions inside map functions.
