Until now, you've been using vector functions inside `mutate()` to create new
columns. In *Vector functions*, you learned how to convert some scalar functions
into vector functions. Sometimes, however, you'll want to use a scalar function 
to create a new column, and you won't be able to convert that scalar function 
into a vector function. 

In this reading, you'll learn how to create new columns with a scalar function 
by using a map function to apply that scalar function to each element of an 
existing column.
