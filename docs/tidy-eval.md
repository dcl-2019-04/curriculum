At some point during the quarter, you might have tried to write a function
that calls a dplyr verb and gotten errors. The dplyr verbs (and many other 
tidyverse functions) work differently than many other functions in R, and 
programming with them will require some new techniques. In this reading, 
you'll about tidy evaluation, which allows you to easily program with dplyr and
other tidyverse verbs.
