It's hard to understand data just by looking at it in a tibble. Visualizations
are one way to gain a better understanding of the relationships present in
your data. Modeling is another approach. 

You can think of a model as an approximation of your data. Often a model with
relatively few parameters can capture much of the complexity of a dataset. By
finding a model that is a good approximation, you can gain insights into your
data.

We're not going to rigorously cover the mathematical foundations of models.
Instead, we'll give you some intuition for how models approximate data and
show you some useful tidyverse tools for fitting and working with models.
