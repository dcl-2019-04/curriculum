  with spatial\ndata: sp and sf.\n\n  - sp has been around for a while (the first
  release was in 2005), and\n    it has a rich ecosystem of tools built on top of
  it. However, it\n    uses a rather complex data structure, which can make it challenging\n
  \   to use.\n\n  - sf is newer (first released in October 2016) so it doesn’t have
  such\n    a rich ecosystem. However, it’s much easier to use and fits in very\n
  \   naturally with the tidyverse.\n\nThere’s a lot you can do with the sf package,
  and it contains many more\nfunctions that we can cover in this reading. The sf package
  [reference\npage](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/index.html) lists all
  of\nthe functions in the package. There are also some helpful articles on\nthe [package
  website](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/), including\n[Simple Features for\nR](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html)
  and [Manipulating\nSimple Feature\nGeometries](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf3.html).\n\n##
  Loading data\n\nTo read spatial data in R, use `read_sf()`. The following code reads
  an\nexample dataset built into the sf package.\n\n``` r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\n\n#
  The counties of North Carolina\nnc <- read_sf(system.file(\"shape/nc.shp\", package
  = \"sf\"))\n```\n\nHere, `read_sf()` reads from a **shapefile**. Shapefiles are
  the most\ncommon way to store spatial data. Despite the name, a shapefile is\nactually
  a collection of files, not a single file. Each file in a\nshapefile has the same
  name, but a different extension. Typically,\nyou’ll see four files:\n\n  - `.shp`
  contains the geometry\n\n  - `.shx` contains an index into that geometry.\n\n  -
  `.dbf` contains metadata about each geometry (the other columns in\n    the data
  frame).\n\n  - `.prf` contains the coordinate system and projection information.\n
  \   You’ll learn more about that shortly.\n\n`read_sf()` can read in the majority
  of spatial file formats, and can\nlikely handle your data even if it isn’t in a
  shapefile.\n\n## Data structure\n\n`read_sf()` reads in spatial data and creates
  a tibble, so `nc` is a\ntibble.\n\n``` r\nclass(nc)\n#> [1] \"sf\"         \"tbl_df\"
  \    \"tbl\"        \"data.frame\"\n```\n\n`nc` functions like an ordinary tibble
  with one exception: the\n**geometry** column.\n\n``` r\nnc %>% \n  select(geometry)\n#>
  Simple feature collection with 100 features and 0 fields\n#> geometry type:  MULTIPOLYGON\n#>
  dimension:      XY\n#> bbox:           xmin: -84.32385 ymin: 33.88199 xmax: -75.45698

  (((-76.56251 3...\n#> 9  MULTIPOLYGON (((-78.30876 3...\n#> 10 MULTIPOLYGON (((-80.02567
  3...\n```\n\nThe `geometry` column contains **simple features**. Simple features
  are\na standard way of representing geometry types. The most basic geometry\ntypes
  are point, linestring, and polygon.\n\n![](spatial-basics_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!--
  -->\n\nThere are also *multi* variants of these basic types: multipoint,\nmultilinestring,
  and multipolygon. These multi types can contain\nmultiple points, linestrings, or
  polygons. The final type, geometry\ncollection, can contain multiple different types
  (e.g., points,\nlinestrings, and multipolygons).\n\nYou can build up complex spatial
  visualizations using just these\ngeometry types. A point, for example, could represent
  a city, a\nmultilinestring could represent a branching river, and a multipolygon\ncould
  represent a country composed of different islands.\n\n`nc`’s `geometry` column contains
  multipolygons.\n\n``` r\nnc$geometry\n#> Geometry set for 100 features \n#> geometry
  type:  MULTIPOLYGON\n#> dimension:      XY\n#> bbox:           xmin: -84.32385 ymin:

  can use `plot()` to visualize the `geometry` column.\n\n``` r\nplot(nc$geometry)\n```\n\n![](spatial-basics_files/figure-gfm/nc-plot-1.png)<!--
  -->\n\nEach row in `nc` represents a single county. If you pull out a single\nrow
  and plot, you’ll get the shape of a single county.\n\n``` r\nalleghany <- \n  nc
  %>% \n  filter(NAME == \"Alleghany\")\n\nplot(alleghany$geometry)\n```\n\n![](spatial-basics_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!--
  -->\n\n`plot()` works, but is limited. In the next unit, you’ll learn how to\nuse
  ggplot2 to create more complex spatial visualizations.\n\n### Geometry\n\nLet’s
  dive a little deeper into the structure of the `geometry` column.\nThe `geometry`
  column is a **list-column**. You’re used to working with\ntibble columns that are
  atomic vectors, but columns can also be lists.\nList columns are incredibly flexible
  because a list can contain any\nother type of data structure, including other lists.\n\n```
  r\ntypeof(nc$geometry)\n#> [1] \"list\"\n```\n\nLet’s pull out one row of the `geometry`
  column so you can see what’s\ngoing on under the hood.\n\n``` r\ncurrituck <- \n
  \ nc %>% \n  filter(NAME == \"Currituck\")\n\ncurrituck_geometry <- currituck$geometry[[1]]\n```\n\nCurrituck
  county is made up of three separate landmasses.\n\n``` r\nplot(currituck_geometry)\n```\n\n![](spatial-basics_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!--
  -->\n\nHow does a single row of the `geometry` column represent these three\nseparate
  shapes? It turns out that each element of `nc`’s `geometry`\ncolumn, including `currituck$geometry`,
  is actually a list of lists of\nmatrices.\n\n``` r\nglimpse(currituck_geometry)\n#>
  List of 3\n#>  $ :List of 1\n#>   ..$ : num [1:26, 1:2] -76 -76 -76 -76 -76.1 ...\n#>
  \ $ :List of 1\n#>   ..$ : num [1:7, 1:2] -76 -76 -75.9 -75.9 -76 ...\n#>  $ :List
  of 1\n#>   ..$ : num [1:5, 1:2] -75.9 -75.9 -75.8 -75.8 -75.9 ...\n#>  - attr(*,
  \"class\")= chr [1:3] \"XY\" \"MULTIPOLYGON\" \"sfg\"\n```\n\nThe top-level list
  represents landmasses, and has one element for each\nlandmass in the county. Currituck
  county has three landmasses, and so\nhas three sub-lists.\n\nIn our data, each of
  these sub-lists only has a single element.\n\n``` r\nmap_int(currituck_geometry,
  length)\n#> [1] 1 1 1\n```\n\nThese sub-lists would contain multiple elements if
  they needed to\nrepresent a landmass that contained an lake, or a landmass that\ncontained
  a lake with an island, etc.\n\nEach of these elements is a matrix that gives the
  locations of points\nalong the polygon boundaries.\n\n``` r\ncurrituck_geometry[[2]][[1]]\n#>
  \          [,1]     [,2]\n#> [1,] -76.02717 36.55672\n#> [2,] -75.99866 36.55665\n#>
  [3,] -75.91192 36.54253\n#> [4,] -75.92480 36.47398\n#> [5,] -75.97728 36.47802\n#>
  [6,] -75.97629 36.51793\n#> [7,] -76.02717 36.55672\n```\n\n## Manipulating with
  dplyr\n\nsf objects like `nc` are tibbles, so you can manipulate them with dplyr.\nThe
  following code finds all counties in North Carolina with an area\ngreater than 2
  billion square meters.\n\n``` r\nnc_large <-\n  nc %>%\n  mutate(area = st_area(geometry)
  %>% as.double()) %>%\n  filter(area > 2e9) \n```\n\n`st_area` finds the area of
  a geometry, and returns an object with\nunits, in this case square meters.\n\n```
  r\nalleghany %>% \n  st_area(geometry)\n#> 611077263 [m^2]\n```\n\nThese units are
  helpful, but can be annoying to work with, which is why\nwe used `as.numeric()`
  in the earlier `mutate()` statement.\n`as.numeric()` converts the results to a regular
  numeric vector.\n\nThe sf package contains many helpful functions, like `st_area()`,
  for\nworking with spatial data. Its [reference\npage](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/index.html)
  lists all\nfunctions in the package.\n\n## Coordinate reference system\n\nEarlier,
  you saw the following matrix.\n\n``` r\ncurrituck_geometry[[2]][[1]]\n#>           [,1]
  \    [,2]\n#> [1,] -76.02717 36.55672\n#> [2,] -75.99866 36.55665\n#> [3,] -75.91192
  36.54253\n#> [4,] -75.92480 36.47398\n#> [5,] -75.97728 36.47802\n#> [6,] -75.97629
  36.51793\n#> [7,] -76.02717 36.55672\n```\n\nThis matrix gives the position of points
  along the boundary of one of\nCurrituck county’s landmasses. Geospatial data represents
  points on the\nearth in terms of longitude and latitude with respect to a **datum**.\nThe
  same point can have a different longitude and latitude with respect\nto different
  datums.\n\nTake two minutes and watch this [simple explanation of\ndatums](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKGlMp__jog).\n\nA
  **coordinate reference system** (CRS) for a geospatial dataset\nconsists of a datum
  together with a **projection** that specifies how\npoints in three dimensions will
  be represented in two. We can use\n`st_crs()` to find the datum and projection of
  our data.\n\n``` r\nst_crs(nc)\n#> Coordinate Reference System:\n#>   EPSG: 4267
  \n#>   proj4string: \"+proj=longlat +datum=NAD27 +no_defs\"\n```\n\nThe datum of
  `nc` is “NAD27”, the [North American\nDatum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Datum)
  of 1927\n(NAD27). And the projection is to simply use the longitude and latitude.\n\nWhen
  plotting multiple datasets, it is important that they all use the\nsame CRS. Otherwise,
  points won’t properly line up. Fortunately,\n`st_transform()` can be used to transform
  datasets to a common CRS, and\nggplot2 will automatically convert layers to have
  a common CRS.\n"
