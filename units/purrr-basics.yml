title: purrr basics
theme: program
needs: [function-basics]

desc: |
  You'll often want to apply the same function to each element of a list or
  vector. Extracting each element and applying that function would be tedious, 
  create a lot of duplicated code, and be nearly impossible for large lists and 
  vectors. Instead, you can use the functions in the purrr package to iterate over
  lists and vectors and perform an action at each element. 
  
  In this unit, you'll learn about the most basic purrr functions: the map 
  functions. You'll also learn about anonymous functions, which will allow you 
  to create custom functions inside map functions.
