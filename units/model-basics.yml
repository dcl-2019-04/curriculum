  As you already know, it's difficult to understand data just by looking at it in
  a tibble. Visualizations are one way to gain a better understanding of the 
  relationships, outliers, and problems present in your data. Modeling is another
  tactic. 
  
  You can think of a model as an approximation of your data. Your approximation 
  will (probably) never fully capture all the variation in your data, so there
  will be a gap between your approximation and the truth. The size of this gap
  determines how well your model approximates (or "fits") your data.
  
  Good approximations are useful because they allow you summarize your data
  in a compact way. If someone asks you about your data, you can hand them
  your model as a summary, instead of the entire data set (note that this is 
  only true of parametric models, which are the only type of model we'll cover).
  
  This course approaches modeling a little differently than other courses. 
  We're not going to rigorously cover the mathematical foundations of models.
  Instead, we'll give you some intuition about what a model does and show you 
  some tools for exploring fitted models.
